# Real-time-assembler

This project makes it possible to write assembly code in real time by using C++. The created code can be run and also deleted in real time, thus for example making it harder to analyze the code if it only exists temporarily. The project itself doesn't have any higher purpose as I merely used to learn how to generate code on runtime and do different things with it. In reality, real time code generation is for example used in graphics cards.

Due to huge time constraints I haven't had nowhere near enough time to work on this project so many of the opcodes are not implemented. Many of the important ones like mov, call etc. are however implemented and can be used as reference on how to implement additional opcodes.

The Real time assembler.cpp contains a small usage example. It can be found [here](../master/Real time assembler/).
